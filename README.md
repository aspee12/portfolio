Hello everyone! This is my portfolio built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with animation effects powered by Framer Motion. If you're interested in using it, feel free to fork and customize it to your liking.

### How to use?

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
``` git clone <repository_url> ```
2. Install the dependencies:
  ``` yarn install ```
3. Start the development server:
    ``` yarn dev ```
    
After executing these commands, your development server will be up and running, allowing you to preview your portfolio locally.

Additionally, I've configured GitHub Actions and Husky for better code quality. GitHub Actions automates workflows, while Husky manages Git hooks to enforce coding standards. These configurations ensure a smoother development process and improved code reliability.

For more details, please refer to the package.json file in the repository.
